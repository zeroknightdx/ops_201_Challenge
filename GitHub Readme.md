this is repo is about  I learned script  to add to my skills to become a special security specialist

I learn how to read and write script such as powershell bash mark down

where I went from the challenges are how to tobacco files and create directories conditional scripts loops and a array and how to change scrips together

my favorite script was backing up files because it teaches you how to backup files for servers and and personal computers to a second location. the skill will be handy for all types of situations especially for disaster plans and just simple redundancy I believe this one will be used more often than the rest of my other skills.

show scripts can be applied to everyday workplace because there's all types of scenarios for example if you hired new employees and you want to have them backup files to a second drive or the network drive you could create an script to automatically back up there files to the system. or if need be and have new employees coming in and needed to create multiple directories on each system to use the crate directory script to make redundancy a lot simpler I need just by executing the make directory script.

truthfully I'm going to continue to try to improve on all of them it's just going to be time management and focus on which ones it will be needed the most it's hard to tell it's been a fun journey

I feel like I still need some work in the Shell department so I'm going to try to work on improving a better understanding of show not going to try to master it soon as possible I'm going to take my time and work out the kinks make sure that I could actually create a shell script without having to triple check my work especially change shell commands together properly
